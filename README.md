What’s Inside
 1. index.html

This file contains all the main content of the CV:

Header: Displays the user's name and job title.
Skills Section: Lists web development skills and proficiencies.
Education: Includes academic background and online certifications.
Experience: Summarizes previous roles and relevant work experience.
Footer / Contact Info: Shows contact address, phone number, and email.

HTML is structured using semantic tags such as:

 `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<p>`, and `<br>`
 Class names like `.Skills`, `.Education`, `.Experiences`, and `.Contacts` are used for styling and clarity.

2. styless.css

This file adds basic styling to the page:

 Sets background color and default font family.
 Applies specific font settings to `.Skills` and `.Education` sections.
 Uses class selectors to style HTML elements cleanly.
