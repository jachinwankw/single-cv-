            I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Tailwind CSS, and responsive web design, with a strong focus on crafting clean, elegant, and modern user interfaces.<br><br>
            I have experience building semantic, accessible layouts that leverage the full power of HTML5 and utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind to create highly maintainable and scalable codebases.<br><br>
            My expertise includes developing responsive designs that gracefully adapt across a wide spectrum of devices and screen sizes, ensuring optimal user experiences everywhere.<br><br>

        <p>
            In JavaScript, I am skilled at writing minimal, unobtrusive code that enhances interactivity without compromising performance or accessibility.<br><br>
            I am comfortable implementing smooth hover animations, state transitions, and responsive behaviors to create intuitive interfaces that feel polished and professional.<br><br>
            My background also covers SQL, where I can efficiently structure data queries, manage relational data, and optimize for performance â€” skills that complement the frontend development process when integrating with backend data sources.<br><br>

            Overall, I bring a thoughtful approach to design and development that balances visual aesthetics, user experience, and code quality, all while adhering to best practices and modern standards.<br><br>
